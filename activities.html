<header> Fun things to do in Sedona</header>
<p> 
Sedona is a city that is jam-packed with things to do for all ages, even boomers. One of the best things to do in Sedona is hike, there are many places in Sedona like Oak Creek Canyon which 
require you to hike to get to, and to experience many things, there are also many small local shopping areas filled with little gems for tourists and locals. Another great thing to do in Sedona is eat,  
as Sedona is in Arizona, a desert there are a lot of unique things to have, such as snake, cactus, fried cactus and many more oddities. Sedona is also home to a large range of Jeep tours which are also 
a blast, rent one of these bad boys and go wild on mountain ranges, which is also a great way to get to popular hiking spots and tourist attractions. Because Sedona is such a mid temperature area in 
Arizona you can go hiking and not get a heat stroke in 2.5 milliseconds, which is always nice. And, the final piece of fun listed here, is to go just sight see; there are many gorgeous things in Sedona 
to see, like a church made out of stone and marble with a gigantic cross in the front of it, or Hell's Kitchen which is a giant sinkhole, or my personal favorite, Slide Rock, Slide Rock is a hilly 
area that has had water run through it for so long that there are little divots that you can sit in that will carry you like a slide. Sedona is just filled with many things and stuff to do that 
I was not able to list all of it but there is far more to enjoy up in Sedona.
