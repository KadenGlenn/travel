<p> 
Sedona is absolutely filled with interesting and rich history. Archeologists suggest that native settlements settled in the area of Sedona approximately 10,000 
years ago. This is part of what makes Sedona so beautiful, as of this day some of the settlements from back then are still standing today for people to visit. 
However, the land was claimed by T.C. Schnebly in 1902 and he named the land Sedona after his wife. These people lived in Oak Creek Canyon for a while before the settlers 
started to move in to what is now what is current day Sedona, because of Sedona's rich history there are many landmarks and naturally formed wonders in Sedona. Sedona has many unique rock formations 
for people to visit, along with many cave systems.
