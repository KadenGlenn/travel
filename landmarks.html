<header> Landmarks in Sedona</header>
<p> A huge part in why Sedona is such a great and interesting place to live, as their are many breathtaking locations in Sedona. One of which is the Oak Crekk Canyon, which is a vast and beautiful 
    canyon, which is almost entirely blanketed in the thick greenery of the common tall pines not only are there the trees to admire there is also a beautiful, glistening stream that cuts right throught the 
    whole canyon, which draws a hard contrast when compared to the thick, red dust that encompasses all of Sedona, Oak Creek Canyon truly is a sight to see. Or there is the Palatki Ruins, shrouded in the shade, 
    and cut right into the side of a mountain, these are the well preserved ruins of the Native Americans who lived here once a very long time ago. The Palatki Ruins is a trip back in time, one in which where 
    you get to see a time in which people lived in a very simple time, living on the land. Not only are there these wonders, there are also many, many more such as; the chapel of the holy cross, slide rock, 
    and Schnebly Hill Vista. These are just a small cut out of preserved history and hundreds of years of the land carefully forming these beautiful land marks that have stood the test of time.
